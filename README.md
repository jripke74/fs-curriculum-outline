# fs-curriculum-outline

Welcome to freeCodeCamp!

This workshop will serve as your introduction to HTML and coding in general. You will learn about headings and paragraph elements.

Step 1
Welcome to your code editor, where you can write HTML code.

Find line 1 in the editor and type this text:

Welcome to freeCodeCamp
When you are done, click the "check your code" button to see if it's correct.

Step 2
Notice that the HTML code you write in the editor shows up in the preview.

Below the text you added, type the following on line 2:

Full Stack Curriculum
When you are done, click the "check your code" button to see if it's correct.

Step 3
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It represents the content and structure of a webpage. In this workshop, you will write the HTML code for a partial curriculum outline.

Below the other two lines of text, add:

Learn the skills to become a full stack developer

Step 4
HTML is made up of elements. The first one you will use is the h1 element:

<h1>Welcome to freeCodeCamp</h1>
It starts with an opening tag (<h1>), ends with a closing tag (</h1>), and has the text it will display in between the tags.

Turn your Welcome to freeCodeCamp text into an h1 element by adding an opening tag in front of it, and a closing tag after it.

Step 5
An h1 element is the main heading of a webpage and you should only use one per page. h2 elements represent subheadings. You can have multiple per page and they look like this:

<h2>I am a subheading.</h2>
Turn the Full Stack Curriculum text into an h2 element by surrounding it with opening and closing h2 tags.

Step 6
When you need to add a paragraph to a web page, you can use the p element like this:

<p>I am a paragraph element.</p>
Turn your Learn all of the skills to become a full stack developer into a paragraph element.
